## About
This project aimed to broaden the knowledge of programming and the use of my knowledge in practice. The main goal was to create a modern application that is functional and
fault-tolerant. This application is used to book seats in a cinema. Users can browse the repertoire, select a day and time, and then reserveSeatConfiguration seats. The seats are divided into
already reserved and unreserved. All data is stored in the database. Users can register and log into the system. Administrator is able to do CRUD operations on movies and
screening times. The app was tested on mobile devices.

## Changelog
